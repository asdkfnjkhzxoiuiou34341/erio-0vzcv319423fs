PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR DEOBFUSCATING 'eblan'

STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:

STEP 1: PREPARATION (30 minutes)
- Set up a good text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Install Lua interpreter for testing
- Create backup of original file
- Set up workspace for analysis

STEP 2: BASIC CLEANUP (2-4 hours)
- Extract hex-encoded strings
- Convert hex to readable text
- Identify string patterns
- Create string mapping table

STEP 3: ARITHMETIC SIMPLIFICATION (4-6 hours)
- Replace hex constants with decimal values
- Simplify modulo operations
- Track variable value changes
- Document arithmetic patterns

STEP 4: CONTROL FLOW ANALYSIS (6-8 hours)
- Map while loop structures
- Identify exit conditions
- Track variable state changes
- Document program flow

STEP 5: LOGIC RECONSTRUCTION (8-12 hours)
- Identify function boundaries
- Rebuild program structure
- Document functionality
- Create readable code

STEP 6: TESTING AND VERIFICATION (2-4 hours)
- Test deobfuscated code
- Compare with original behavior
- Debug any issues
- Final documentation

TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES:

1. STRING EXTRACTION:
   - Use regex: \\\d{1,3}
   - Convert hex to ASCII
   - Build lookup table

2. ARITHMETIC SIMPLIFICATION:
   - Calculator for hex conversion
   - Track variable values
   - Simplify expressions

3. CONTROL FLOW MAPPING:
   - Draw flow diagrams
   - Document loop conditions
   - Track variable states

4. CODE RECONSTRUCTION:
   - Start with basic structure
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test frequently

COMMON PITFALLS:
- Don't rush through complex parts
- Document everything as you go
- Test code frequently
- Keep backups of progress

SUCCESS TIPS:
- Work systematically
- Take breaks when stuck
- Use multiple approaches
- Collaborate if possible

This guide provides a structured approach to
tackling the complex obfuscation in the eblan file.
