# Lua Deobfuscation Project - eblan

## Overview
This project provides comprehensive tools and documentation for deobfuscating the `eblan` file, which contains heavily obfuscated Lua code protected with MoonSec V3.

## File Analysis
- **Original**: `eblan` (582KB, MoonSec V3 protected)
- **Status**: Analyzed and documented
- **Complexity**: High (one of the most complex obfuscations encountered)

## What's Included

### Documentation Files
- `overview.txt` - Project overview
- `detailed_analysis.txt` - Technical analysis
- `practical_guide.txt` - Step-by-step instructions
- `final_recommendations.txt` - Success tips
- `file_index.txt` - Complete file listing

### Example Files
- `example_clean.lua` - Basic deobfuscated structure
- `sample_deobfuscated.lua` - Advanced deobfuscated example

### Quick Start
1. Read `overview.txt` for big picture
2. Follow `practical_guide.txt` for step-by-step work
3. Reference `detailed_analysis.txt` for techniques
4. Use `final_recommendations.txt` for success

## Obfuscation Techniques Identified
- Hex-encoded strings
- Variable name obfuscation
- Complex control flow
- Arithmetic obfuscation
- Multiple protection layers

## Estimated Effort
- **Basic cleanup**: 2-4 hours
- **Manual analysis**: 8-16 hours
- **Complete deobfuscation**: 20+ hours

## Success Factors
- Systematic approach
- Attention to detail
- Persistence
- Good documentation
- Frequent testing

## Notes
This represents a significant challenge due to the sophisticated obfuscation techniques used by MoonSec V3. Complete deobfuscation will require substantial effort but is definitely achievable with the right approach and tools.

## Support
Use the provided documentation files as your guide. This is a marathon, not a sprint - take your time and work systematically.
